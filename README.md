# Sample Android App

A foundational Android project developed as part of an internship, showcasing my journey into mobile app development. This project involved applying core Android concepts, learning best practices, and delivering a functional solution to meet the assigned task requirements. It served as a hands-on experience to build technical skills and understand real-world app development workflows.
